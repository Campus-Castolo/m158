## Project planning

### 1. Preliminary Assessment:
- Identify all existing plugins and themes on the current site.
- Note down custom code snippets or modifications.
- Document the current hosting environment and configurations.

### 2. Set Clear Objectives:
- Define the specific goals of the migration (e.g., improved performance, updated design).
- Outline any additional features or improvements desired.
- Use GitHub Projects for example
- Make Timeline for this

### 3. Choose a New Hosting Provider:
- Research and compare hosting providers.
- Review server specifications and features.

### 4. Backup and Testing:
- Create a detailed backup of the current site, including the database and files.
- Set up a staging environment to test the migration thoroughly.

### 5. Migration Process:
- Document step-by-step procedures for migrating the database, themes, plugins, and media files.
- Address potential issues and create contingency plans.

### 6. Theme and Plugin Compatibility:
- Check and update themes and plugins for compatibility with the new WordPress version.

### 7. SEO Considerations:
- Redirect old URLs to new ones to maintain SEO.
- Update sitemaps and inform search engines of the migration.

### 8. Communication Plan:
- Inform stakeholders, including users, about the migration plan.
- Provide detailed instructions for any necessary actions on their part.
- What happens if any unforseen actions occur

### 9. Post-Migration Monitoring:
- Have a general plan for monitoring but refine it based on post-migration feedback and observations.
